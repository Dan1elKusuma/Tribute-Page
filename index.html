                <h1>Text Examples</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1998</strong> - Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 Project in Detroit and coined
                        the
                        phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong> - Kent Beck published the first edition of the book <em>Extreme
                            Programming
                            Explained</em>, introducing Extreme Programming, and the usage of user stories in the
                        planning
                        game.</li>
                    <li><strong>2001</strong> - Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation. <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The Card(or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The <em>Conversation</em> is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers,
                                testers, etc). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The <em>Confirmation</em> ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been
                                    reached.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2001</strong> - The XP team at Connextrea in London devised the user story format and
                        shared
                        examples with others. </li>
                    <li><strong>2004</strong> - Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of
                        cards in his book <em>User Storied Applied: For Agile Software Development</em> that is now
                        considered the standard referencce for the topic according to Martin Fowter. Cohn names Rachel
                        Davies ad the inventor of user stories. While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits
                        the
                        team as a whole with the invention.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>2014</strong> - After a first article in 2005 and a blog in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton
                        published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach
                        the
                        identification of user stories and to structure the storied to give better visibility to their
                        interpedence.
